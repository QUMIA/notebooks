# notebooks
This repository contains notebooks related to the QUMIA project.

To run these notebooks you will need to build appropriate environments. We have therefore left a few environments around.

The file environments_for_examination.md allows you to build the envrironment to run the files:
            missing_muscles_final3.ipynb
            ultra_prediction_visualization_v6

The data is not provided on purpose. These noteboks share the procedures needed for working with the data
without the data itself.
